# Data Preprocessing 
The data set obtained for this analysis was provided on kaggle and can be viewed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data).
Before establishing any correlations and while this data we will first look at the PDFs (Probability Density Function) of each feature.
